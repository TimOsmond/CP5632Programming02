# CP5632_Programming02
## Practicals carried out for Master's course CP5632, Programming 2, at JCU Cairns.

### About Me
As an ex-Army Officer and secondary school senior science teacher, I am currently studying for a MIT at JCU Cairns. 
I am a mature age student, and I am looking forward to a career in IT.

### My Ethos
I am keen to produce code that is:
- readable, and that it should be easy to understand.
- maintainable, and that it should be easy to change.
- testable, and that it should be easy to test.
- efficient, and that it should be easy to make it run faster.
- reusable, and that it should be easy to reuse.
- documented, and that it should be easy to read the documentation.
- simple, and that it should be easy to write.
